# Timed JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This webpage has a short quiz on JavaScript basics.  The quiz contains 5 questions and has a time limit of 75 seconds.  Incorrect answers will deduct 10 seconds from the timer.  Your score is the amount of time that is left.

JavaScript was used to update the elements based off the actions taken by the user.  I created this project in order to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
